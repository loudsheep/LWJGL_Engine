# Game engine in [LWJGL](https://www.lwjgl.org/)

This is just for learning purposes. It is not my engine, I am just following YouTube tutorial [Coding a 2D Game 
Engine in Java](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtrSb4XxIVbp8AKuEAlwNXDxr99e3woGE).
If you want to make similar engine follow Gabe's tutorial on YT.
